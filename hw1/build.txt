If you have issues on Windows, first ensure that your configured python is python 3.7, or alternatively we can simply enter
  alias python=python3

In addition, we want to ensure that we have the following python packages, which we can verify by entering
  pip install pandas
  pip install numpy
  pip install urllib
  pip install tabulate

Make sure to modify the constants.py file as necessary. Specifically, if we need to use different accession numbers, then we can modify the accession_set list to include more/less fasta files to be scraped and analyzed from the UniProt database.

In addition, ensure that our global constants at the top of main.py are properly set, as necessary for whichever case of matrix/scoring we are doing.

Give the main function in main.py a look--there are numbered steps explaining what we need to do.
Comment or uncomment these as desired.

Next, with all the settings and code sections we need to run set up, we can simply run the script by entering
  python main.py

Our individual results would normally then be printed to the results/ folder, but for the purpose of the specified test cases as deemed necessary in the spec, we have combined some specific results into output.txt in the top-layer of the environment.
