If you have issues on Windows, first ensure that your configured python is python 3.7, or alternatively we can simply use

  alias python=python3

In addition, we want to ensure that we have the following python packages, which we can verify by entering
  pip install pandas
  pip install numpy
  pip install csv
  pip install urllib

Make sure to modify the constants.py file as necessary. Specifically, if we need to use different accession numbers, then we can modify the accession_set list to include more/less fasta files to be scraped and analyzed from the UniProt database.
